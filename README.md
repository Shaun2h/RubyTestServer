# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running. <br> 
But since it's a test/learning repo, I won't be doing that. <br>

Look into testread.txt for current notes. Notation and the such will be written since I have terrible memory. Explanations too.







Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions
